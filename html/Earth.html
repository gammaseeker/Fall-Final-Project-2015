					Earth is a parent to us, it provides us with everything we can possibly ask for:
					food, water, resources, air, and everything to sustain life.
					This jewel of the galaxy is at risk. We humans are hurting ourselves, and more importantly, we are hurting the Earth.

					Earth is home to millions of species of life. <br />
					Climate change is wiping out many species, at a frightening rate.
					Precious animals and life are dying at a rate that rivals mass extinctions.
					We are entering a period of human-caused mass extinctions.
					It's scary that the next generation of life may not live to see another day.

						Now, it is our responsiblility to contribute.

						To optimize our carbon emissions, we must conserve our electricity usage.
						Shutting off electrical gadgets when they are not used is a great start.
						It technically does not save power but it saves resources to generate power.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						To conserve water usage and pollution, we must moderate our water usage.
			 			Do not leave faucets running when they are not used.
						Try to avoid using plastic disposable water bottles, they are terrible for the environment.
						
					</li>
					<br />
					Most importantly, we must spread the word and encourage others to reduce our carbon footprint.
